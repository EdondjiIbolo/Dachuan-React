In CNC turning, the workpiece is usually fixed to the spindle of the lathe by a fixture and machined by the rotation of the spindle. The tool moves along the axis of the workpiece to remove the material and form the desired shape and size."

    "SUMERISE_DESCRIPTION_2": "Drilling is a machining process that mainly creates a circular hole in a workpiece through a rotating drill bit. In this process, the drill bit is fixed to the spindle of a drilling press or other drilling equipment and rotated at high speed, then gradually advanced downward or diagonally into the workpiece to remove the material and create the desired hole.CNC drilling is a precise drilling operation that utilizes computer numerical control (CNC) technology. ",
    "SUMERISE_DESCRIPTION_3": "Precise control of drill position, speed, and feed is achieved by pre-programmed commands to control the precise position and movement of the drill bit to ensure that the diameter, depth, and positional accuracy of the hole meet the design requirements. At the same time, it is also necessary to select the appropriate drill type and cutting data to adapt to different workpiece materials and machining requirements."
